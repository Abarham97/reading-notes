 Reading05 |  A linked list is a dynamic data structure used to store collections of data. An analogy likens it to a chain of paper clips, with each clip representing a node containing a value and a pointer to the next node. The linked list allows for dynamic addition and removal of nodes. The process of adding involves creating a new node object, updating pointers, and handling special cases. Linked lists are useful for scenarios with changing data sizes due to their efficient insertion and deletion operations. The summary also provides a walkthrough example of defining node and linked list classes, adding nodes, and printing the list. It offers a cheat sheet for quick reference on node and linked list class structures, adding and deleting nodes, and searching for values. A visual representation of a linked list is provided, showing the concept of nodes and pointers in action.|
