i can not fouces on one prject but of all of our projects we create functions and objects

## You Aren’t Gonna Need It 

## Describe some benefits of releasing an MVP of a product?

    1- Reduce wasted engineering hours
    2-Get the product to early customers as soon as possible
    3-Find a base for other products
    4-Build a brand very quickly
## What are some potential pitfalls of waiting until a product is fully mature to release it.
The MVP differs from the conventional market testing strategy of investing time and money early to implement a product before testing it in the market. It is intended to ensure that the market wants the product before large time and monetary investments are made.
