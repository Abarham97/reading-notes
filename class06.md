## Java OO Tutorial
1-What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?
Class : class is a blueprint that definesÂ  the structure and behavior of object 
where we can define the properties  and the methods for that object.

Object: is an instance of a class created based on the class properties and methods.

2-Explain to a non-technical friend the concept of inheritance in Java?

it look like the inheritance in our real life where you inherit some of your father properties and some of his behavior and you can take of how he is look like, same as in java where the subclass(child)whill derive the properties and method from the superclass (father).

## Java Static Keyword

1-Static methods are also called what? Why?

they called class method because they are referred  to the calss not to the object ,these method are associated  to the class and can be called from the class it self we don't need to create an object to call 
these methods.
2- How can you access a variable of a class without instantiating an object from that class?

we need to define it method and the class as static class so we access directly.

## Java Singleton Class


1-What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience?

Design Pattern is the way that we build our structure and process to solve the probelem,helping developers create maintainable, scalable, and flexible code.

Observer Pattern:
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is used for implementing event handling systems.

2-What is a Singleton?
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that a certain resource or service is available in a single instance throughout your application.
