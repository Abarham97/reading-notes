## Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

we dont change the state.

## Define purely functional programming.
Purely functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data

## How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

based on the diffrence between purely functional programming and traditional Java programming i think we will start have less error
